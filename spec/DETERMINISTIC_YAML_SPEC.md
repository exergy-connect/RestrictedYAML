# Deterministic YAML Specification

A subset of YAML designed to reduce variance while maintaining token efficiency.

## Key Principle

**Deterministic YAML is valid YAML** - any standard YAML parser (PyYAML, yaml-cpp, etc.) can parse it correctly. We don't introduce new syntax; we simply restrict which YAML features are allowed.

## Goals

1. **Reduce Variance**: Eliminate multiple ways to represent the same data
2. **Maintain Token Efficiency**: Keep fewer tokens than JSON
3. **LLM-Friendly**: Make it easier for LLMs to generate consistently
4. **Deterministic**: Same data always produces the same YAML
5. **YAML-Compatible**: Fully parseable by any standard YAML parser

## Specification

### 1. Keys

- **Always unquoted ASCII identifiers**: `[A-Za-z0-9_]+`
- If a key does not match this pattern, the output is invalid
- Always end keys with a colon
- Keys must be sorted lexicographically (Unicode codepoint ordering) at every level

### 2. String Values - Deterministic Quoting Rules

**Rule: Quote a string if ANY of the following apply:**

1. **Contains any YAML indicator**: `: # | > - { } [ ] & * ! % @ `` ` ``
2. **Starts with any indicator character**: `- ? : [ ] { } ! * & # | > ' " % @`
3. **Starts or ends with whitespace**
4. **Is empty** (empty string must be `""`)
5. **Matches any YAML scalar pattern for**:
   - Integers (e.g., `42`, `0`, `-123`)
   - Floats (e.g., `3.14`, `0.5`, `.5`)
   - Booleans (e.g., `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`, `Yes`, `No`, `ON`, `OFF`)
   - Null (e.g., `null`, `~`, empty)
   - Special values (e.g., `.nan`, `.inf`, `+.inf`, `-.inf`)
6. **Contains a newline** (forces quoting + `\n` escape)
7. **Contains numeric-looking patterns**:
   - Leading zeros (e.g., `01`, `007`)
   - Underscores (e.g., `1_000`)
   - Plus signs (e.g., `+42`, `+.5`)
   - Octal/hex notation (e.g., `0o10`, `0xFF`)
   - Timestamps (e.g., `2023-02-01`)
   - Floats without leading digits (e.g., `.5`)

**Unquoted strings are allowed only if they match**: `[A-Za-z0-9_]+`

### 3. Escape Policy (Mandatory)

When quoting, use double quotes and escape only:

- `\` → `\\`
- `"` → `\"`
- newline → `\n`
- tab → `\t`
- control chars → `\xNN` (where NN is hex)

**No other escapes allowed.** This gives you a deterministic minimal escape set.

### 4. Numeric Canonicalization

**Rule: One canonical number form**

**Integers:**
- Canonical base-10, no leading zeros
- Examples: `0`, `42`, `12345`, `-123`
- No `+` sign
- No underscores
- If a number can't be represented in this format → quote it and treat as string

**Floats:**
- Canonical decimal, at least one digit before and after the decimal point
- Examples: `3.14`, `0.5`, `10.0`
- No exponent notation (no `1e10`, `1E-5`)
- No `+` sign
- No underscores
- No trailing decimal point (`1.` is illegal, use `1.0`)
- If a number can't be represented in this format without precision loss → quote it and treat as string

This is identical to how canonical JSON and canonical CBOR handle numbers: strict and boring.

### 5. Booleans and Null

- **Boolean values**: `true` or `false` (lowercase only)
- **Null**: `null` only (not `~` or empty)
- Bare keys without values are never allowed

### 6. Lists

- **Always block style** with `- item`
- Never inline lists `[item1, item2]`
- Indentation must be exactly 2 spaces
- **Empty list**: Use flow style `[]` (canonical empty collection)

Example:
```yaml
tags:
  - dev
  - ops
```

Empty list:
```yaml
tags: []
```

### 7. Objects/Mappings

- **Always block style** with indentation
- Never flow style `{key: value}`
- 2-space indentation for all nested mappings
- Keys must be sorted lexicographically (Unicode codepoint ordering)
- **Empty mapping**: Use flow style `{}` (canonical empty collection)

Example:
```yaml
config:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
```

Empty mapping:
```yaml
config: {}
```

### 8. Indentation Rules (Minimal and Strict)

- **Root level**: Column 1 only (no leading spaces)
- **Every nested structure**: +2 spaces exactly
- **No tabs ever**
- **No trailing spaces**
- **No blank lines inside structures**
- This removes whitespace-based ambiguity entirely (YAML is notoriously whitespace-sensitive)

### 9. Multi-line Strings

- **Forbidden**
- If needed, use `\n` inside a double-quoted string
- Example: `description: "Line 1\nLine 2"` not:
  ```yaml
  description: |
    Line 1
    Line 2
  ```

### 10. Comments - Explicitly Forbidden

**Formal Rule: Comments are strictly forbidden in Deterministic YAML.**

#### Philosophy: Kintsukuroi for Data

**The pottery was always going to break. The question is whether we hide the cracks or fill them with gold.**

Deterministic YAML applies the Japanese art of **Kintsukuroi** (金継ぎ) to configuration files. In Kintsukuroi, broken pottery is repaired with gold, making repairs visible and beautiful. The mended object is more valuable for having been broken.

**Comments are human insight that must be preserved and made visible, not discarded.** Traditional YAML comments (`#`) are treated as fragile metadata that gets lost, ignored, or rewritten unpredictably during:
- Round-trip parsing
- Normalization
- Regeneration
- Data transformation

**Deterministic YAML treats comments as first-class data** — as `$human$` key-value pairs that survive all operations. Every `$human$` field is a golden seam showing where human judgment intervened. This ensures human insight doesn't vanish—it becomes visible evidence of human contribution.

**In Deterministic YAML, comments are gifts.** The spec doesn't let them vanish under the tree; instead, we wrap them carefully as deterministic data so every human insight survives regeneration.

**The `$human$` field isn't just documentation—it's the golden seam that makes repairs visible, not invisible.**

#### The AI Boundary: Reducing Guesswork

**Both humans and LLMs are fundamentally non-deterministic—no intermediate system can "fix" that.** Deterministic YAML isn't trying to make the process fully deterministic, only more so.

The key difference is at the **AI boundary**:

- **With standard YAML**: Comments are stripped before the model processes the file. Human reasoning never reaches the LLM as input—it's invisible to the transformation process. With less information, the model must guess about intent.

- **With Deterministic YAML**: `$human$` fields are structural data, not discardable syntax. The LLM receives them as explicit input, so human reasoning can be considered during transformation. The model may still act non-deterministically, but there's a non-zero chance it comes closer to human intent because it has more complete information.

**The goal isn't perfect determinism—it's reducing the guesswork.** Instead of the model operating blind to human reasoning, it can consider that reasoning when making decisions. The outputs are still non-deterministic, but possibly less so.

#### Prohibition

- **YAML comment syntax (`#`) is not allowed anywhere in Deterministic YAML**
- This includes:
  - Line comments: `# This is a comment`
  - Inline comments: `key: value  # comment`
  - Block comments: `# Comment block`
- **Rationale**: Comments introduce variance - the same logical data can have different comments, breaking determinism. More importantly, YAML comments are fragile metadata that gets lost during processing.

#### Sanctioned Alternative: `$human$` Fields

**Comments matter — enough that they need to be handled deterministically, not thrown away.** Use a `$human$` key with a string value to preserve human insight as data:

```yaml
# INVALID - Comments are forbidden
name: John
# age: 30  # This is also invalid

# VALID - Use $human$ field instead
$human$: "User profile configuration"
name: John
age: 30
```

**Rules for `$human$` fields:**

1. **One per object maximum** - No multiple `$human$` keys in the same mapping
2. **Always positioned first** - Before any other keys in the object
3. **Consolidate context** - All human reasoning for that scope in one annotation
4. **Nested scopes** - Child objects can have their own `$human$` field
5. **Value format** - Must be a quoted string (since it contains spaces/punctuation), or a structured object
6. **Empty values** - Empty `$human$` values are stripped during normalization
7. **Namespace safety** - Extremely unlikely to collide with real field names

**Correct:**
```yaml
service:
  $human$: Context for this service object
  name: auth
  config:
    $human$: Context for this config object
    timeout: 30
```

**Incorrect:**
```yaml
service:
  $human$: Context 1
  name: auth
  $human$: Context 2  # ❌ Multiple $human$ keys in same object
  timeout: 30
```

**Example with nested comments:**
```yaml
$human$: "Main configuration"
config:
  $human$: "Database settings"
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
```

**Structured `$human$` values** (for rich metadata):
```yaml
$human$:
  comment: "Updated connection limits"
  author: "alice@example.com"
  date: "2024-03-15"
```

**Benefits of `$human$` fields:**
- **Semantically clear**: Instantly communicates "this is human-authored context"
- **Preserved as data**: Comments are part of the data structure, not metadata that can be lost
- **Deterministic**: Same data always produces same YAML (comments included)
- **Round-trip safe**: Comments survive regeneration, normalization, and any YAML parser
- **Always first**: `$human$` appears first in each object, making human context immediately visible
- **LLM-friendly**: Clear, unambiguous syntax for generating and preserving documentation
- **Human insight preserved**: The human touch of comments is maintained, not discarded
- **Machine-readable signal**: LLMs can learn to recognize and preserve this pattern

**Note**: The `$human$` convention is a data-level solution, not a syntax-level feature. It maintains determinism while allowing documentation. The `$human$` key is reserved and always sorts first within its parent object.

### 11. Human Field Integrity (Optional): Embedded CRC Marker

The `$human$` field may contain an embedded CRC32 checksum at the end of its value.

Because multi-line scalars are forbidden in Deterministic YAML, the entire value MUST be represented as a single quoted string. You may include `\n` escape sequences if desired, but they are not required before the CRC marker.

#### 11.1 Format

The CRC marker MUST appear at the very end of the `$human$` string value, using the exact syntax:

```
[crc32:<base64>]
```

**Example (valid Deterministic YAML):**

```yaml
$human$: "Human-authored text that must remain stable.[crc32:3kH6xA==]"
```

If you prefer human-readable line separation, that is allowed:

```yaml
$human$: "Line one.\nLine two.\nLine three.[crc32:3kH6xA==]"
```

Both are legal. **No newline before the marker is required.**

#### 11.2 Checksum Scope

CRC32 MUST be computed over all bytes before the marker, i.e.:

- Everything up to the first character of `[` in `[crc32:...]`
- No special handling of `\n` escapes: the literal byte sequence of the string (after YAML unescaping) is what gets hashed

In short:

**CRC32 covers: the exact UTF-8 bytes of the string value minus the final `[crc32:...]` segment.**

There is no rule requiring a newline before the checksum.

#### 11.3 Determinism Requirements

When a CRC marker is present:

- The marker MUST use the exact format `[crc32:<base64>]`.
- `$human$` content (everything before the marker) MUST NOT be altered by deterministic transforms.
- Normalizers MUST leave the `$human$` field untouched.
- A mismatch between CRC and content marks the document as invalid.

#### 11.4 LLM Interaction Rules

When a `$human$` field includes a CRC marker:

- LLMs MUST NOT modify `$human$`.
- LLMs MUST NOT regenerate or recompute the CRC.
- LLMs MUST preserve the quoted string byte-for-byte.

If a user asks to modify `$human$`, the correct behavior is:

- Output a version without the CRC marker, so external tooling recomputes it.

#### 11.5 Intended Purpose

The embedded CRC provides:

- Protection against unintentional drift
- A deterministic way to detect changes
- Stability for human-authored intent
- Compatibility with Deterministic YAML's constraints
- Simple external validation

**It is not cryptographic; it is purely a drift-detection mechanism.**

### 12. Anchors and Aliases

- **Forbidden**
- `&anchor` and `*alias` syntax is not permitted
- Reduces complexity and variance

### 13. Document Markers

- **Forbidden**
- No `---` (document start) or `...` (document end)
- Single document only

### 14. Key Ordering (Mandatory)

- **Mappings must be lexicographically sorted by key**, using Unicode codepoint ordering
- This means:
  - Consistent normalization for all data
  - Diffable output
  - Identical materialization across runs, platforms, languages, and models
- This is the single biggest win for LLM determinism besides quoting rules

### 15. Encoding

- **UTF-8 only**
- **No BOM**
- **Normalized newlines** (`\n` only, not `\r\n` or `\r`)
- This prevents cross-platform divergence

## Ban Ambiguous Scalars Explicitly

Some YAML interpretations are "legal but cursed" for LLMs. **Rule: Disallow implicitly typed scalars except:**

- lowercase `true`
- lowercase `false`
- `null`

**Everything else ambiguous must be quoted.**

Examples that must be quoted:
- `Yes`, `No`, `ON`, `OFF`
- `.nan`, `.inf`, `+.inf`, `-.inf`
- Numeric-looking things: `01`, `1_000`, `+.5`
- Octal/hex notations: `0o10`, `0xFF`
- Timestamps: `2023-02-01`
- Floats without leading digits: `.5`
- Any string starting with indicator characters

This removes YAML's type lottery.

## Comparison with Standard YAML

### Standard YAML (High Variance)

The same data can be represented in many ways:

```yaml
# Variant 1: Unquoted
name: John
age: 30

# Variant 2: Quoted
name: "John"
age: 30

# Variant 3: Single quotes
name: 'John'
age: 30

# Variant 4: Flow style
{name: John, age: 30}

# Variant 5: With comments
name: John  # User name
age: 30
```

**Result**: 5+ different valid representations of the same data.

### Deterministic YAML (Low Variance)

The same data has only one representation:

```yaml
age: 30
name: John
```

**Result**: 1 canonical representation (keys sorted, deterministic quoting).

## Comparison with JSON

### Token Count

**JSON:**
```json
{"name": "John", "age": 30, "active": true}
```
~11 tokens (with quotes and braces)

**Deterministic YAML:**
```yaml
active: true
age: 30
name: John
```
~8 tokens (no quotes, no braces, keys sorted)

**Savings**: ~27% fewer tokens than JSON

### Variance

**JSON**: Very low variance (only formatting differences)
- Pretty: `{"name": "John"}`
- Compact: `{"name":"John"}`
- Normalized: Same structure

**Deterministic YAML**: Low variance (only key ordering differences, but keys are sorted)
- Always unquoted strings (when allowed)
- Always block style
- Always 2-space indentation
- No comments, no flow style
- Keys always sorted

**Standard YAML**: High variance (many representations)
- Multiple quote styles
- Flow vs block
- Comments
- Anchors/aliases

## Benefits

### 1. Reduced Variance

- **Standard YAML**: 40-80% uniqueness across runs
- **Deterministic YAML**: 0-5% uniqueness (only if data structure differs)
- **Variance reduction**: ~95-100%

### 2. Token Efficiency

- **JSON**: ~30 tokens (compact)
- **Deterministic YAML**: ~23 tokens
- **Savings**: ~23% fewer tokens

### 3. LLM-Friendly

- Fewer choices = more consistent output
- Clear rules = easier to learn
- Predictable structure = lower entropy
- Deterministic quoting = no ambiguity

### 4. Deterministic

- Same data → same YAML (with sorted keys)
- Easier to compare/diff
- Easier to validate
- Identical across platforms, languages, and models

## Trade-offs

### What We Lose

1. **Comments**: Can't add inline documentation
   - **Solution**: Use `$human$` fields for documentation

2. **Flow Style**: Can't use compact `{key: value}` syntax (except empty collections)
   - **Solution**: Always use block style (more readable anyway)

3. **Multi-line Strings**: Can't use literal/folded blocks
   - **Solution**: Use `\n` escape sequences

4. **Flexibility**: Can't use all YAML features
   - **Solution**: This is intentional - we want less flexibility

### What We Gain

1. **Consistency**: Same data always produces same output
2. **Predictability**: LLMs generate more consistent outputs
3. **Lower Variance**: 95-100% reduction in output variance
4. **Token Efficiency**: Still 20-30% fewer tokens than JSON
5. **Simplicity**: Easier to parse, validate, and generate
6. **Determinism**: Identical output across all platforms and implementations

## 🔧 Converting Existing YAML

**Comment preservation is deterministic, not dependent on LLM behavior.**

### Automatic Conversion

```bash
# Convert standard YAML to Deterministic YAML
dyaml convert config.yaml --output config.dyaml
```

Or using Python:

```python
from lib.deterministic_yaml import DeterministicYAML

# Read existing YAML file
with open('config.yaml', 'r') as f:
    standard_yaml = f.read()

# Convert to Deterministic YAML (preserves comments as $human$ fields)
deterministic_yaml = DeterministicYAML.normalize(standard_yaml)

# Write output
with open('config.dyaml', 'w') as f:
    f.write(deterministic_yaml)
```

### Canonical Mode (Strip Comments)

For pure data without human annotations:

```python
# Convert and strip all $human$ fields
deterministic_yaml = DeterministicYAML.normalize(standard_yaml, preserve_comments=False)
```

Or strip existing `$human$` fields:

```python
import yaml
from lib.deterministic_yaml import DeterministicYAML

# Load YAML with $human$ fields
data = yaml.safe_load(yaml_str)

# Strip all $human$ fields for canonical mode
data_only = DeterministicYAML.strip_human(data)

# Generate pure data YAML
canonical_yaml = DeterministicYAML.to_deterministic_yaml(data_only)
```

## Implementation

See `deterministic_yaml.py` for:
- `to_deterministic_yaml()`: Convert Python data to deterministic YAML
- `validate()`: Check if YAML conforms to deterministic syntax
- `normalize()`: Convert any YAML to deterministic format (with optional comment preservation)
- `strip_human()`: Remove all `$human$` fields for canonical mode

See `deterministic_yaml_parser.py` for:
- Custom parser implementation (optional - standard YAML parsers work too)

## YAML Compatibility

**Deterministic YAML is fully compatible with both YAML 1.1 and YAML 1.2 parsers.**

Deterministic YAML uses only the most basic, common YAML features that work identically in both versions:

- Canonical booleans (`true`, `false`) - supported in both
- Canonical null (`null`) - supported in both
- Basic block-style mappings and lists - supported in both
- Quoted strings - parsed identically in both
- Standard numeric formats - supported in both

Since Deterministic YAML avoids all version-specific features (no sexagesimal numbers, no merge keys, no ambiguous boolean/null values), it works with any standard YAML parser regardless of version.

```python
import yaml

# Deterministic YAML can be parsed by any YAML parser
deterministic_yaml = """
name: John
age: 30
active: true
"""

data = yaml.safe_load(deterministic_yaml)  # Works with YAML 1.1 and 1.2 parsers
```

This means:
- ✅ No special parser required
- ✅ Works with existing YAML tooling (both 1.1 and 1.2)
- ✅ Can be used in any YAML-based system
- ✅ Backward compatible with YAML ecosystem

## Usage Example

```python
from deterministic_yaml import DeterministicYAML

data = {
    'name': 'John',
    'age': 30,
    'active': True
}

# Generate deterministic YAML
yaml_str = DeterministicYAML.to_deterministic_yaml(data)
# Result: Always the same format (keys sorted, deterministic)

# Validate
is_valid, error = DeterministicYAML.validate(yaml_str)

# Normalize existing YAML
normalized = DeterministicYAML.normalize(existing_yaml)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Sort keys alphabetically** for maximum determinism (mandatory)
2. **Use `$human$` fields** instead of comments
3. **Validate output** to ensure it conforms to deterministic syntax
4. **Normalize existing YAML** before comparing or processing
5. **Use deterministic YAML for LLM generation** to reduce variance
6. **Use UTF-8 encoding** with `\n` line endings only

## Conclusion

Deterministic YAML provides:
- **95-100% variance reduction** vs standard YAML
- **20-30% token savings** vs JSON
- **Deterministic output** (same data → same YAML)
- **LLM-friendly** (easier to generate consistently)
- **YAML-compatible** (works with any YAML parser)

It's the sweet spot: more efficient than JSON, more consistent than standard YAML, and fully deterministic.
